What sequence of println statements will generate the following output?
  
---------------------------------------
A "quoted" String is
'much' better if you learn
the rules of "escape sequences."
Also, "" represents an empty String.
Don't forget to use \" instead of " !
'' is not the same as "

package InternshipAssignment;

public class Q_4 {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        System.out.println("A \"quoted\" String is");
        System.out.println("\'much\' better if you learn");
        System.out.println("the rules of \"escape sequences.\"");
        System.out.println();
        System.out.println("Also, \"\" represents an empty String.");
        System.out.println("Don\'t forget to use \\\" instead of \" !");
        System.out.println("\'\' is not the same as \"");

    }
